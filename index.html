For your after plastic surgery care, it is a good idea to think seriously about where you will stay and who will look after you in the crucial hours post-surgery. These operations are often complex, involving multiple procedures that can extend your recovery period and call for additional care. Furthermore, recovery from plastic surgery can require special techniques including icing, ointment application, and bandage changes that can be difficult for an untrained friend or family member to perform correctly.
